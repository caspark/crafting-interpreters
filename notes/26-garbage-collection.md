1. `Obj` now has `type`, `isMarked`, and `next` fields - how much memory do they take up, can you come up with something more compact, and is there a cost to that?

There are 5 types of objects, so we need 5 bits of information for that.

Then we need an additional 1 bit for `isMarked`, so 6 bits plus a pointer.

That those 6 bits should be able to be packed into the `next` pointer using a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_pointer - e.g. https://github.com/HDembinski/stateful_pointer is for C++ but claims that it can pack another 24 bits of information into a pointer.

2. When the sweep phase traverses a live object, it clears the `isMarked` field to prepare it for the next collection cycle. Can you come up with a more efficient approach?

Use flip-flopping approach to vary behavior between 1, 3, 5, etc and 2, 4, 6 etc runs:

* Leave `isMarked` set to `true` after finishing each "odd" GC.
* Every "even" GC, instead set `isMarked` set to `false` for objects which are still referenced. In this case, all `isMarked` objects set to `true` should be freed, since they must have become unreachable since the "odd" GC.

3. Mark-sweep is only one of a variety of garbage collection algorithms out there. Explore those by replacing or augmenting the current collector with another one. Good candidates to consider are reference counting, Cheneyâ€™s algorithm, or the Lisp 2 mark-compact algorithm.

Out of time.
