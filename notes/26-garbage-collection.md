1. `Obj` now has `type`, `isMarked`, and `next` fields - how much memory do they take up, can you come up with something more compact, and is there a cost to that?

TODO

2. When the sweep phase traverses a live object, it clears the `isMarked` field to prepare it for the next collection cycle. Can you come up with a more efficient approach?

TODO

3. Mark-sweep is only one of a variety of garbage collection algorithms out there. Explore those by replacing or augmenting the current collector with another one. Good candidates to consider are reference counting, Cheneyâ€™s algorithm, or the Lisp 2 mark-compact algorithm.
