1. How do other languages handle accessing a field that does not exist? Pick an approach and implement it.

Generally they provide some sort of keyword (or built in method on objects) that returns true or false when checking whether a field exists in Lox. E.g. Python's `in`.

Implemented `in` keyword in `chap27-challenge-1`.

2. Add a way to access a field using a dynamically created field name - e.g. `myObj["someField"]` or similar.
