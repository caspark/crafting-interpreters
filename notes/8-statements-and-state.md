> The REPL no longer supports entering a single expression and automatically printing its result value. Thatâ€™s a drag. Add support to the REPL to let users type in both statements and expressions. If they enter a statement, execute it. If they enter an expression, evaluate it and display the result value.

Done - interesting part of the code is:

```java
    private Stmt expressionStatement() {
        Expr expr = expression();
        if (check(SEMICOLON)) {
            advance();
            return new Stmt.Expression(expr);
        } else if (printNakedExpression) {
            return new Stmt.Print(expr);
        } else {
            throw error(peek(), "Expect ';' after expression.");
        }
    }
```

> Maybe you want Lox to be a little more explicit about variable initialization. Instead of implicitly initializing variables to nil, make it a runtime error to access a variable that has not been initialized or assigned to, as in:

Relevant changes:

```java
class Environment {
    public static final Object UNINITIALIZED_VALUE = new Object();
    
    Object get(Token name) {
        if (values.containsKey(name.lexeme)) {
            Object val = values.get(name.lexeme);
            if (val == UNINITIALIZED_VALUE) { // intentional reference equality
                throw new RuntimeError(name, "Uninitialized variable '" + name.lexeme + "'.");
            } else {
                return val;
            }
        }
        
        // etc etc
    }
}

class Interpreter {
    @Override
    public Void visitVarStmt(Stmt.Var stmt) {
        Object value = null;
        if (stmt.initializer == null) {
            environment.define(stmt.name.lexeme, Environment.UNINITIALIZED_VALUE);
        } else {
            value = evaluate(stmt.initializer);
            environment.define(stmt.name.lexeme, value);
        }

        return null;
    }
}
```

* Prints 3
* Yep
* Same as Rust, which allows variable rebinding while referencing that same variable data. Other languages I'm familiar with don't allow variable name rebinding (compile time error - e.g. Java) or use "initialization is declaration" semantics (e.g. Python, Ruby).
* ...hopefully users will expect it to return 3 as well :)
