1. Each string requires two separate dynamic allocations—one for the ObjString and a second for the character array. Accessing the characters from a value requires two pointer indirections, which can be bad for performance. A more efficient solution relies on a technique called flexible array members. Use that to store the ObjString and its character array in a single contiguous allocation.

Done in `chap19-challenge-1` branch.

2. When we create the ObjString for each string literal, we copy the characters onto the heap. That way, when the string is later freed, we know it is safe to free the characters too.
This is a simpler approach but wastes some memory, which might be a problem on very constrained devices. Instead, we could keep track of which ObjStrings own their character array and which are “constant strings” that just point back to the original source string or some other non-freeable location. Add support for this.

3. If Lox was your language, what would you have it do when a user tries to use + with one string operand and the other some other type? Justify your choice. What do other languages do?
