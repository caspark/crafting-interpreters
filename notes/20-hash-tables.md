1. Make hash tables support other primitive types as keys. Also, how do user classes make things harder?

`chap20-challenge1` has a hacked up solution.

User defined classes make it harder because you need to have a way for users to specify the hashing and equality-comparison methods - e.g. conventions for specific methods on classes that implement that.

2. Research hash tables in different open source systems, see what they do and figure out why.

3. Benchmark this hash table and document why you chose the benchmarks you did.
